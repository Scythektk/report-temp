      <h2>1.1. What is Digital Accessibility</h2>
      <p>
        Digital accessibility is about making communication services to the public online accessible to people with
        disabilities by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Perceptible:</strong> For example, facilitating the visual and auditory perception of content by the user;
          offering textual equivalents to any non-textual content; creating content that can be presented in
          different ways without loss of information or structure (for example, with a simplified layout).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Usable:</strong> For example, providing the user with orientation elements to navigate, find the content;
          making all the features accessible on the keyboard; giving the user enough time to read and use the
          content; not conceive of content likely to cause epileptic seizures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Understandable:</strong> For example, making pages work in a predictable way, helping the user to correct
          input errors and
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Robust:</strong> For example, optimizing compatibility with current and future uses, including assistive
          technologies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>1.2. Test Objective and Reference</h2>
      <p>
        The aim of this document is to evaluate the accessibility level of Société Générale – Application URL's
        Application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The standard used for the test is the RGAA version 4.1, published by the French government.
        This reference document is based on international recommendations WCAG 2.1 (Web Content Accessibility
        Guidelines) level AA.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is fully compatible with WCAG 2.1 level AA, as well as with European standard EN 301 549 V2.1.2.
        For all the criteria cited in the body of this test, a reference to the corresponding success criteria of the
        WCAG 2.1 can be found on the official website of the RGAA:
      </p>
      <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/rgaa-accessibilite/methode/criteres/">
        https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/rgaa-accessibilite/methode/criteres/
      </a>
      <p>
        The RGAA version 4.1 reference document provides a method of applying and evaluating WCAG 2.1
        international recommendations, more effective to implement during tests, and easier to use for the
        people who will then have to take charge of the corrections.
      </p>
